   This is a webpage to talk about myself, Sujan Chandra Mondol, a bit. I am from the city of Dhaka in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>, a country from the South Asia. <br>

 <p>
 I attended Amirjan High School that is close to my home.
 </p>
 After finishing school, I attended the undergraduate program in Civil Engineering at the <a href="https://www.kuet.ac.bd/" target="_blank"> Khulna University of Engineering & Technology </a>. Since it was in another city, I had to move to there for all those years.
 </p>
 <p>
 Now I am again away from home as I am here at the <a href="https://www.byu.edu/" target="_blank">Brigham Young University </a> to attend my graduate study.
